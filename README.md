# Data-Science-Work-sample-Assessment
Overview:

This project analyzes user engagement during a race event, focusing on fan challenges, predictive accuracy, virtual merchandise purchases, sponsorship interactions, and live event engagement. The goal is to identify key factors influencing user behavior and develop predictive models for merchandise purchases.

Steps Performed:

Data Cleaning and Preprocessing: Loaded data, checked for missing values, and normalized data using Min-Max Scaler.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Analyzed distribution plots, correlation matrices, and box plots to understand user behavior.
User Behavior Analysis: Identified top users by virtual merchandise purchases and live event engagement.
Clustering: Applied K-Means clustering to segment users based on engagement levels.
Predictive Modeling: Developed a linear regression model to predict merchandise purchases based on fan challenges, predictive accuracy, and sponsorship interactions.
Data Visualization: Created visualizations to illustrate user engagement distribution, correlations with merchandise purchases, and sponsorship interactions.

Key Findings:

Strong correlations between fan challenges, predictive accuracy, and virtual merchandise purchases.
Clustering revealed distinct user engagement patterns.
Predictive model achieved [insert MSE and R2 scores].

Technologies Used:

Python
Pandas
