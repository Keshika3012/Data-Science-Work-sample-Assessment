# Data-Science-Work-sample-Assessment
Overview:

This project analyzes user engagement during a race event, focusing on fan challenges, predictive accuracy, virtual merchandise purchases, sponsorship interactions, and live event engagement. The goal is to identify key factors influencing user behavior and develop predictive models for merchandise purchases.

Steps Performed:

Data Cleaning and Preprocessing: Loaded data, checked for missing values, and normalized data using Min-Max Scaler.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Analyzed distribution plots, correlation matrices, and box plots to understand user behavior.
User Behavior Analysis: Identified top users by virtual merchandise purchases and live event engagement.
Clustering: Applied K-Means clustering to segment users based on engagement levels.
Predictive Modeling: Developed a linear regression model to predict merchandise purchases based on fan challenges, predictive accuracy, and sponsorship interactions.
Data Visualization: Created visualizations to illustrate user engagement distribution, correlations with merchandise purchases, and sponsorship interactions.

Key Findings:

Strong correlations between fan challenges, predictive accuracy, and virtual merchandise purchases.
Clustering revealed distinct user engagement patterns.
Predictive model achieved [insert MSE and R2 scores].

Technologies Used:

Python,
Pandas,
NumPy.
Matplotlib,
Seaborn,
Scikit-learn

Files:

race.csv: Dataset used for analysis.

New Fan Challenge based on Analysis: 
Racing Insights

This project proposes a new fan challenge, "Racing Insights", where fans analyze racing data to predict upcoming race outcomes. The challenge aims to increase engagement (+30%), social media interaction (+25%), and time spent on the racing website/app (+20%). Predicted monetization outcomes include +15% virtual merchandise sales, +10% sponsorship revenue, and +5% premium content sales. The challenge utilizes existing racing data platforms, with a development timeline of 8 weeks and budget allocation split between development (40%), marketing (30%), and rewards/sponsorships (30%). This project provides a unique opportunity for the racing industry to drive growth, revenue, and fan interaction through data-driven competition.
